# Webcam Testing Guide - Development Mode

## üéØ The Problem

The **competition parameters** are optimized for **bright LED lightbars** on real RoboMaster armor plates. If you're testing with a regular webcam (like MacBook's built-in camera) and regular colored objects, **detection will fail** because:

1. ‚ùå **No bright LEDs** - Regular objects don't glow like LED lightbars
2. ‚ùå **Different lighting** - Indoor webcam lighting ‚â† competition arena lighting
3. ‚ùå **Camera differences** - Webcams have auto-exposure, auto-white-balance
4. ‚ùå **Threshold too high** - 0.65 is for VERY bright objects, not regular colors

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Development Mode

The demo now has **TWO MODES**:

### üîß Development Mode (Default for macOS)
- **For**: Testing with webcam and regular colored objects
- **Uses**: Relaxed parameters, lower threshold (0.35), channel subtraction
- **Perfect for**: Learning, algorithm development, testing without real armor

### üèÜ Competition Mode
- **For**: Actual RoboMaster competition with bright LED armor
- **Uses**: Strict parameters, high threshold (0.65), optimized for LEDs
- **Perfect for**: Jetson deployment, final testing with real armor

---

## üéÆ Quick Start: Webcam Testing

### Step 1: Verify Mode

The demo is currently in **DEV_MODE**. You'll see this when you run it:

```
Mode: DEVELOPMENT (Webcam Testing)
  - Relaxed parameters for regular objects
  - No bright LEDs required
  - Binary threshold: 0.35
```

### Step 2: What to Test With

**Good test objects** (things that work well):

‚úÖ **Colored markers** (blue/red dry-erase markers held vertically)
‚úÖ **Colored pens/pencils** (2 parallel ones)
‚úÖ **Colored tape** (strips on white paper)
‚úÖ **Phone/tablet** (show blue/red rectangles on screen)
‚úÖ **Printed** paper strips (colored rectangles)
‚úÖ **Toy blocks** (rectangular LEGO bricks)

**What the algorithm looks for**:
- Two **tall rectangles** (vertical orientation)
- Similar height
- **Blue** or **Red** color (depending on mode)
- Parallel to each other
- Reasonable spacing between them

### Step 3: Test Setup

Example with markers:

```
1. Take 2 BLUE markers/pens
2. Hold them vertically (‚Üë‚Üë) 
3. Keep them parallel
4. Space them 3-5 cm apart
5. Point webcam at them
6. Press 'D' to see debug view
```

**Visual Example**:
```
    |  |     ‚Üê Two blue markers held vertically
    |  |        Spacing: 3-5 cm
    |  |        This simulates lightbar pair!
```

## üîç Understanding the Detection Process

### Step 1: Color Filtering

Press `D` to see debug view (3 panels):

1. **Original**: What the camera sees
2. **Grayscale**: After color filtering
   - Blue objects appear **white**
   - Red objects appear **black** (or vice versa)
   - Background is darker
3. **Binary**: After thresholding
   - Your objects should be **bright white**
   - Background should be **black**

### Step 2: What Good Detection Looks Like

**‚úÖ Good binary image**:
```
‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà  ‚Üê Clean white rectangles
‚ñà‚ñà          ‚ñà‚ñà        ‚Üê Clear shapes
‚ñà‚ñà          ‚ñà‚ñà        ‚Üê Minimal noise
‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà  
```

**‚ùå Poor binary image**:
```
‚ñë‚ñë‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë  ‚Üê Noisy, fragmented
‚ñì‚ñë‚ñì‚ñë‚ñì‚ñë‚ñì‚ñë    ‚Üê Too much background noise
‚ñë‚ñì‚ñë‚ñì‚ñë‚ñì‚ñë‚ñì    ‚Üê Shapes not clear
```

## üéõÔ∏è Real-Time Tuning

### If Detection Fails

**Problem**: No detection at all
**Solutions**:
1. Press `-` to **lower threshold** (try 0.25-0.35)
2. Press `S` to **lower min area**
3. Press `D` to see what's happening
4. Make sure objects are blue/red (press `R` or `B` to switch)

**Problem**: Too many false detections
**Solutions**:
1. Press `+` to **raise threshold** (try 0.40-0.50)
2. Press `W` to **raise min area**
3. Improve lighting (brighter room)

**Problem**: Detects objects but doesn't pair them
**Solutions**:
1. Hold objects more **parallel**
2. Adjust **spacing** (try 3-5 cm apart)
3. Make objects more **similar size**

## üîÑ Switching to Competition Mode

Once you have real armor with LEDs, switch to competition mode:

### Method 1: Edit Code
```cpp
// In armor_detector_demo.cpp, line 62:
#define DEV_MODE false   // Change true to false
```

### Method 2: Runtime Override
```bash
# Set environment variable
export RM_COMPETITION_MODE=1
./armor_detector_demo
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
./build.sh
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Lighting Matters
- **Bright room** = better detection
- **Avoid** backlighting (camera faces window)
- **Direct light** on colored objects helps

### Tip 2: Color Selection
```bash
./armor_detector_demo 0 blue   # Detect blue objects
./armor_detector_demo 0 red    # Detect red objects
```
- Press `B` for blue, `R` for red while running
- Test with the color that contrasts most with background

### Tip 3: Debug View is Your Friend
- Press `D` to toggle debug view
- Watch the **Binary** panel
- Your objects should be clean white blobs

### Tip 4: Use Contrast
- **Blue objects** work best on **white/light** background
- **Red objects** work best on **dark** background
- Avoid objects same color as background

### Tip 5: Size Matters
- Objects should be **5-15 cm** tall in camera view
- Too small = filtered as noise
- Too large = not recognized as lightbars

- Cluttered background: 10-30%

**FPS**:
- MacBook webcam (720p): 25-35 FPS
- Better lighting = Better FPS

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No detection at all"

**Check**:
1. Is camera working? (see video feed)
2. Are objects blue/red? (press B/R to switch)
3. Is threshold too high? (press `-` to lower)
4. Are objects in frame and visible?

**Try**:
```bash
# Lower threshold dramatically
# While running, press `-` 5-10 times
# Threshold should go to ~0.20-0.25
```

### "Detects one lightbar but not a pair"

**Check**:
1. Are both objects similar size?
2. Are they parallel? (angle < 12¬∞)
3. Are they spaced 2-6 cm apart?
4. Are both visible and clear?

**Try**:
- Make objects more parallel
- Adjust spacing
- Ensure consistent lighting on both

### "Too many false positives"

**Check**:
1. Is background too busy/colorful?
2. Is threshold too low?
3. Is room too bright/reflective?

**Try**:
```bash
# Raise threshold
# While running, press `+` 3-5 times
# Or press `W` to increase min area
```

## üìù Switching Between Modes

### When to Use Each Mode

**Use DEV_MODE when**:
- ‚úÖ Testing algorithm without real hardware
- ‚úÖ Learning how detection works
- ‚úÖ Developing on macOS/laptop
- ‚úÖ Using webcam and regular objects

**Use COMPETITION_MODE when**:
- ‚úÖ Have real RoboMaster armor with LEDs
- ‚úÖ Testing on Jetson with industrial camera
- ‚úÖ Final integration testing
- ‚úÖ Competition deployment

---

## üéì Learning Outcomes

By testing in dev mode, students learn:

1. **Color filtering** - How RGB/SUB methods work
2. **Thresholding** - Effect of different threshold values
3. **Contour detection** - What makes a good lightbar
4. **Geometric matching** - Why parallel and spacing matter
5. **Real-time tuning** - How parameters affect results

Then when they get real armor:
- Switch to competition mode
- Parameters are already optimized!
- Just focus on integration

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **‚úÖ Start**: Test with simple objects in dev mode
2. **üìö Learn**: Understand each processing step
3. **üéØ Tune**: Experiment with real-time adjustments
4. **üìñ Read**: Study PARAMETER_TUNING.md for theory
5. **üèÜ Deploy**: Switch to competition mode when ready

---

**Key Takeaway**: Development mode lets you **learn and test the algorithm** without needing expensive armor plates and LEDs. Once you understand how it works, switching to competition mode is just changing one line! üéâ
